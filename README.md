# A Comparison of Deep Learning Methods For Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

This repository implements and evaluates three deep learning architectures (MLP, CNN, and CNN-LSTM) for human activity recognition using smartphone sensor data.

Repository Structure:

UCI_data/: Contains the Human Activity Recognition dataset used to train and evaluate all models

MLP Model Results/: Outputs from the MLP model code

CNN Model Results/: Outputs from the CNN model code

CNN-LSTM Model Results/: Outputs from the CNN-LSTM model code

MLP_model.ipynb: Implementation and training code for the MLP model

CNN_model.ipynb: Implementation and training code for the CNN model

CNN-LSTM_model.ipynb: Implementation and training code for the CNN-LSTM model

.gitattributes: Git attributes configuration file
