# A Comparison of Deep Learning Methods For Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

This repository implements and evaluates three deep learning architectures (MLP, CNN, and CNN-LSTM) for human activity recognition using smartphone sensor data.

Repository Structure:

UCI_data/: Contains the Human Activity Recognition dataset used to train and evaluate all models

CNN-LSTM Model Results/: Performance metrics and outputs from the CNN-LSTM architecture

CNN Model Results/: Results and evaluation data from the CNN model

CNN-LSTM_model.ipynb: Implementation and training code for the CNN-LSTM hybrid architecture

CNN_model.ipynb: Implementation and training code for the Convolutional Neural Network model

.gitattributes: Git attributes configuration file
